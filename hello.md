The `penguins` data from the
[**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package")
package contains size measurements for 344 penguins from three species
observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths
